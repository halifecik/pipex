John Doe and his loving family
Have lived happily ever after
In the swamp stolen off a good sir
Named Big man the biggest man Shrek

Which begs the question does the Turkish Economy even stand a chance
Against which seems to be an unstopable force at first glance
Feeling as if this writing were a bit too long for a test
But what can you do man thats 42 for ya!

John Doe and his family bright,
Lived in joy, no woes in sight.
In a swamp they claimed with glee,
From Big Man Shrek—was it for free?

But lo, one wonders, does it stand,
The Turkish economy, firm and grand?
Against a force so wild, so vast,
Unstoppable—can it last?

This test feels long, I must confess,
Yet here we are in 42’s little mess!
